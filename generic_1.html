							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A global retail company specialising in luxury goods employs over 10,000 sales staff across a number of stores internationally in Asia, Europe, South-America, and the United States. Business is very good, however, the company is looking to improve their sales of big ticket luxury items (defined as single item sales exceeding $10,000.00) with a view to expand their business moreinto this space. Due to record profits in the previous financial year, CEO would like to re-invest asubstantial portion of this profit toward this expansion plan. </p>

							<p>A statistical analysis is conducted to understand the factors that influence sales counts. The CEO is interested in determining which variables have a significant impact on sales and how well sales can be predicted on these variables. In this analysis, generalised linear models (GLM) will be used to model the relationship, specifically between:</p>
							
							<p> - Sales and the four major style/layouts stores across to identify the international standard. </p>
							<p> - Review proposals: staff experience level with big ticket sales is more important than store layout. </p>
							<p>Queries:</p>
							
							<p>Of the four major style/layouts across your stores, which one would you recommend become the international standard for your company, based solely on big ticket item sales performance in the past year? </p>
							
							<p>Does the available data support the assertion that the staff experience level with big ticket sales is more important than store layout? </p>
